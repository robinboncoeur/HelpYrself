Cloning An SSD on a Mac
***********************

Disk Utility has always been able to create clones, although the app refers to the process as Restore, as in restoring data from a source drive to a target drive. The restore function isn't just for drives. It will work with just about any storage device that you can mount to your Mac, including disk images, hard drives, SSDs, and USB flash drives.

**How Restore Works**

The Restore function in Disk Utility uses a block copy function that can speed up the copy process. It also makes an almost exact copy of the source device. What "almost exact" means is that a block copy moves everything in a data block from one device to the other. The results are almost an exact copy of the original. A file copy copies the data file by file. While the information remains the same, the location of the file on the source and destination devices will likely be different.

Using a block copy is faster, but it does have some limits that affect when it can be used, the most important being that copying block by block requires that both the source and destination devices be first unmounted from your Mac. This ensures that block data doesn't change during the copy process. Don’t worry, though; you don’t have to do the unmounting. Disk Utility’s Restore function takes care of that for you. But it does mean that neither the source nor the destination can be in use when you use the Restore capabilities.

**To Restore a Non-Startup Volume**

You can’t use the Restore function on the current startup drive, or any drive that has files in use. If you need to clone your startup drive, you can make use of either your Mac's Recovery HD volume or any drive that has a bootable copy of OS X installed.

	1. Launch Disk Utility, located at /Applications/Utilities.
	2. The Disk Utility app will open, displaying a single window divided into three spaces: a toolbar, a sidebar showing currently mounted drives and volumes, and an info pane, showing information about the currently selected device in the sidebar.
	3. In the sidebar, select the volume to which you want to copy/clone data. The volume you select will be the destination drive for the Restore operation.
	4. Select Restore from Disk Utility’s Edit menu.
	5. A sheet will drop down, asking you to select from a drop-down menu the source device to use for the Restore process. The sheet will also warn you that the volume you selected as the destination will be erased, and its data will be replaced with data from the source volume.
	6. Use the drop-down menu next to the "Restore from" text to select a source volume, and then click the Restore button.
	7. The Restore process will begin. A new drop-down sheet will display a status bar indicating how far along in the Restore process you are. You can also see detailed information by clicking the Show Details disclosure triangle - although there's really not much there. Note: *this process takes a long time (hours) especially if the source is via usb... we're talking hours!*
	8. Once the Restore process is complete, the drop-down sheet’s Done button will become available. Click Done to close the Restore sheet.
	

**Restore Using a Startup Drive**

When you use the Restore function, both the destination and the source must be able to be unmounted. Your startup drive can't be active if you want to restore it. Instead, you can start your Mac from another volume that contains a bootable version of the Mac OS. The one you use can be any volume attached to your Mac, including a USB flash drive, an external, or the Recovery HD volume.

A complete step-by-step guide is available in `Use the Recovery HD Volume to Reinstall OS X or Troubleshoot Mac Problems <https://www.lifewire.com/use-recovery-hd-volume-to-reinstall-os-x-2259971>`_.





***************************
Slow Boot after SSD Upgrade
***************************

**Question**:

My MacBook Pro extremely slow after SSD Upgrade. I upgraded the standard hard drive to a SSD. I cloned the factory drive to the SSD using Super Duper. After cloning the HDD to the SSD I installed it and turned it on. It booted up but not quite as quickly as I would expect for an SSD.

    * Verified and repaired disk permissions.
    * Restarted. Boot up time about 1 minute 20 seconds.
    * Shut down.
    * Reset PRAM.
    * Boot up time about 1 minute.
    * Restarted. Boot up time about 43 minutes.

Didn't work.

**Answer**:

The startup disk setting is pointing to a disk that's no longer in your system. Most probably the OS can't find it and is waiting for it to spin up: it won't try the new SSD until a timeout occurs:

    1. Go to System Preferences -> Startup Disk
    2. Click on the bottom left Lock tu unlock the changes
    3. Select Macintosh HD (it's likely to be the only on the list)
    4. Click 'Restart...'

Be patient: the restart can take a few minutes.

Where is This File?
*******************

To quickly find the fully-qualified path to a file, open a copy of terminal and drop the file onto it.



*********************
Saving YouTube Videos
*********************

You will need Python for this: I use Python3. You will need to install PyTube, which you can get `here <https://github.com/nficano/pytube>`_ or `in the ReadTheDocs page <https://python-pytube.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/install.html>`_. Keep that first address, as you may need to update PyTube.

The script to download a file is the following::

    #!/usr/local/bin/python3
    # PyTuber02.py
    # Simplify importing YouTube videos with pytube
    from pytube import YouTube
    # import sys

    # sFile = sys.argv[1]
    sFile = input("Enter YouTube URL: ")

    if len(sFile) == 0:
        print("No file link passed: nothing to do")
    else:
        YouTube(sFile).streams.first().download()

I've got the script saved in the Movies folder, and call it this way::

    ~/Movies/PyTuber02.py

in Terminal, from anywhere that I might have 'cd-d' to, then copy and past the URL of the video I wish to download. No dependency on SaveFro.net or other browser helpers anymore.

However, it's not a perfect solution... not because of the solution but because YouTube keeps moving the goalposts. Recently (err, today) tried to download a file::

    Enter YouTube URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFRFgRm1BYE

and got::

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "/Users/robinhahn/Movies/PyTuber02.py", line 13, in <module>
        YouTube(sFile).streams.first().download()
      File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pytube/__main__.py", line 88, in __init__
        self.prefetch_init()
      File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pytube/__main__.py", line 97, in prefetch_init
        self.init()
      File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pytube/__main__.py", line 133, in init
        mixins.apply_signature(self.player_config_args, fmt, self.js)
      File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pytube/mixins.py", line 49, in apply_signature
        signature = cipher.get_signature(js, stream['s'])
      File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pytube/cipher.py", line 245, in get_signature
        tplan = get_transform_plan(js)
      File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pytube/cipher.py", line 64, in get_transform_plan
        name = re.escape(get_initial_function_name(js))
      File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pytube/cipher.py", line 40, in get_initial_function_name
        return regex_search(pattern, js, group=1)
      File "/usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pytube/helpers.py", line 65, in regex_search
        .format(pattern=pattern),
    pytube.exceptions.RegexMatchError: regex pattern (\bc\s*&&\s*d\.set\([^,]+\s*,\s*\([^)]*\)\s*\(\s*(?P<sig>[a-zA-Z0-9$]+)\() had zero matches

Here's where the Issues page on github is useful: apparently the regex had been tweaked chez YouTube, which caused the script to fail. You'll find details on the `Issues page <https://github.com/nficano/pytube/issues>`_ on pending fixes to the problem.

Eventually: fortunately, the developer keeps a close eye on it.

In the meantime, to pip-install directly from the original project::

    pip install git+https://github.com/nficano/pytube.git

Seems that one needs to fix cypher.py from time to time. One such regex string would be::

    r'\bc\s*&&\s*d\.set\([^,]+\s*,\s*\([^)]*\)\s*\(\s*(?P<sig>[a-zA-Z0-9$]+)\('



***************************
Make a Py Script Executable
***************************

Make sure you have::

    #!/usr/local/bin/python3

at the top of the script (for Python3 scripts). Then, in Terminal, issue a::

    chmod +x -/path/NameOfScript.py
    


**********************************
Make a file executable in Terminal
**********************************

Shell scripts must be executable files in order to run. You can use the chmod command to indicate that the text file is executable (that is, its contents can be run as a shell script). In the Terminal app  on your Mac, use the cd command to move into the directory that contains the file you want to make executable. For example::

    cd YourScriptDirectory

Enter the chmod command. For example::

    chmod 755 YourScriptName.sh

After making the shell script file executable, you can run it by entering its pathname::

    ~/Documents/Dev/YourScriptName.sh

or::

    cd ~/Documents/Dev/ 
    ./YourScriptName.sh

Description

Samyang’s **24mm T1.5 VDSLR II ED AS IF UMC** is a wide angle manual focus cine lens designed for full frame and smaller sensor sizes and is known for its beautiful bokeh. It has been carefully engineered for professional film and video work, with the focus gear ring allowing the use of follow focus systems.

The decoupled aperture changes quietly and smoothly via a second gear ring. 

The T number of 1.5 refers to the actual light transmission, while distance scales are marked on both sides of the lens to allow easy and precise control. This lens features 13 elements in 12 groups, including 4 extra low dispersion (ED) and 2 glass aspherical elements (ASP). These combine to minimise colour aberration and produce exceptional image quality with high contrast. Samyang’s Ultra Multi Coating (UMC) technology optimises light transmission and minimises flare and ghosting. A detachable petal-shaped lens hood is supplied.

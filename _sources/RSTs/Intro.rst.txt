A Quick Note on why HelpYrself
******************************

I'm getting old and forgetful and keep reinventing the wheel, searching for answers that I'd already dealt with not all that long ago.

Hence, this document.

As in all of open source, we tend to create solutions to "scratch our own itch". If anyone else finds it useful, fantastic. However, as with anything published, information can become dated, no-longer-relevant or, because the goal-posts have moved, just plain wrong. Consider this when using this information.

Once you've decided:

  * Select A.

  * Select B. 

  * To identify C.

  * Finally, click on D.


Note: setting defaults have been arbitrarily set - these have yielded reasonable results. You will almost certainly find better settings, which is the whole point of sharing this.

Citizenship

Ceremony: Australian citizenship pledge
=======================================

All Australian citizens should understand what it means to be a citizen. It is a critical part of building our nation.

Most people make the Australian citizenship pledge at a citizenship ceremony. You might hear people call it the 'pledge of commitment'.

Making the pledge is a public commitment to Australia. It means that you are accepting the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship.

If you learn the meaning behind the pledge, you will begin to understand what Australian citizenship means.

You can choose between 2 versions of the pledge. One mentions God and the other does not.

Pledge 1
========

  From this time forward, under God,
  I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,
  whose democratic beliefs I share,
  whose rights and liberties I respect, and
  whose laws I will uphold and obey.

Pledge 2
========

  From this time forward,
  I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people,
  whose democratic beliefs I share,
  whose rights and liberties I respect, and
  whose laws I will uphold and obey.

Advance Australia Fair
======================

Modified by the National Australia Day Council, these lyrics were officially adopted in April 1984, as follows:

Australians all let us rejoice,
For we are young and free;
We've golden soil and wealth for toil;
Our home is girt by sea;
Our land abounds in nature's gifts
Of beauty rich and rare;
In history's page, let every stage
Advance Australia Fair.
In joyful strains then let us sing,
Advance Australia Fair.

Beneath our radiant Southern Cross
We'll toil with hearts and hands;
To make this Commonwealth of ours
Renowned of all the lands;
For those who've come across the seas
We've boundless plains to share;
With courage let us all combine
To Advance Australia Fair.
In joyful strains then let us sing,
Advance Australia Fair.

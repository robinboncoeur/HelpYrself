A Quick Note on why "HelpYrself"
********************************

I'm getting old and forgetful and keep reinventing the wheel, searching for answers that I'd already dealt with not all that long ago.

Hence, this document.

As in all of open source, we tend to create solutions to "scratch our own itch". If anyone else finds it useful, fantastic. However, as with anything published, information can become dated, no-longer-relevant or, because the goal-posts have moved, just plain wrong. Consider this when using this information.

LaTeX and Learning
==================

From a learning perspective, I'm a bit challenged. I'll sit through tutorials for a while but if I don't see a practical application to some instruction, this ability to retain the information suffers.

For example: one of the key abilities of LaTeX is to insert math formulae into the body of a text. For mathematicians and math students and math hobbyists and - I'm sure - a whole slew of other folk: crucial information.

But I discovered LaTeX (pronounced "Lah-Tek") has an elegant book-making solution, far superior to Word or any of the booklet apps one can find and pay for. So, I got stuck into learning how to use a very powerful book-publishing template called "Memoir". Again, the youtubers put a lot of effort into supporting the maths folk and only gave a glancing nod to the novelists.

Still, there's a lot of crucial stuff in those videos. So, one of the next workflows to fleshing out these "HelpYrself" pages is taking dictation from the videos.

On the Mac: Toggling Hidden Files
=================================

Make sure the folder is actually active, then press [Shift] [Command] [.]

Signatures
==========

Number of pages to a signature: 4. Here's the `video to watch <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9O4kFTOEh6k>`_ to get clear on the saddle-stitch technique.



Book Glue
=========

PVA is best: poly-vinyl acetate. Need to find it online.


Slow Boot after SSD Upgrade
===========================

MBP extremely slow after SSD Upgrade. What's wrong with my mac?

I have a MPB 15" 2.53 mid 2009. I upgraded the standard hard drive to a SSD (512 GB Sandisk X210) purchased from ifixit.

I cloned the factory drive to the SSD using Super Duper. After cloning the HDD to the SSD I installed it and turned it on, it booted up fine but not quite as quickly as I would expect for an SSD.

Verified and reparied disk permissions.

Restert. Boot up time about 1 minute 20 seconds.

Shut down.

Reset PRAM

Boot up about 1 minute.

Restart. Boot up time about 43 minutes.

I have no idea what happened in the middle there but something is obviously not working right. Now when I click on applications they go gray then take several minutes before launching. I'm not sure what to do. Please help!

Answer:

The internet had the answer for me. Apparently your startup disk setting is pointing to a disk that's no longer in your system. I'm guessing the OS can't find it and is waiting for it to spin up. It doesn't try the new SSD until a timeout occurs.

Go to system preferences and set your Startup Disk setting to be the new disk and I'll bet that changes everything. It did for me.

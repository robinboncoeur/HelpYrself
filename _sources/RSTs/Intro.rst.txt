A Quick Note on why HelpYrself
******************************

I'm getting old and forgetful and keep reinventing the wheel, searching for answers that I'd already dealt with not all that long ago.

Hence, this document.

As in all of open source, we tend to create solutions to "scratch our own itch". If anyone else finds it useful, fantastic. However, as with anything published, information can become dated, no-longer-relevant or, because the goal-posts have moved, just plain wrong. Consider this when using this information.

Creating Dotpoints
==================

Once you've decided:

  * Select A.

  * Select B. 

  * To identify C.

  * Finally, click on D.


Note: setting defaults have been arbitrarily set - these have yielded reasonable results. You will almost certainly find better settings, which is the whole point of sharing this.



Links Management
================

Blender for Mac users, please refer to the `Mac user help <http://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/6173/where-does-console-output-go>`_ page.

An Observation
**************

As you can see from the example, an example of a fully-qualified path for Linux would be:

   /home/robyn/Documents/Blender/Projects/AllTextures/AllSkin/Antonia/

or, for the Mac:

   /Volumes/500GB/Blender/Projects/AllTextures/AllSkin/Antonia/

or, for Windows:

   E:\\MyRuntime\\runtime\\textures\\VendorName\\ImagesFolder\\Character\\

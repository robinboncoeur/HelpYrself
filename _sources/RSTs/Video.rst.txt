These scripts allow commandline processing of audio and video files. FFMPEG must be installed on your PC and accessible from the commandline processor.



===================
Concatenating Files
===================

Copy and paste this script template into a plain text document, save as an .sh file and make it executable::

    $ cat mylist.txt
    file '/path/to/file1'
    file '/path/to/file2'
    file '/path/to/file3'

    $ ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i mylist.txt -c copy output.mp4

Note: *had to change things a bit to get rid of a problem with non-monotonous DTS in output stream issues, based on a suggestion made on StackExchange. First, rename the long file name (e.g., NT66B REVELATION-DSgtRXWSzBg.f136.mp4) to a generic shorter name (NTb.mp4).*

So, convert the .mp4 files to .MTS in Terminal::

    ffmpeg -i NTb.mp4 -q 0 NTb.MTS

I made the appropriate changes to the input file (DesVids.txt)::

    file './Rev/NTa.MTS'
    file './Rev/NTb.MTS'
    file './Rev/NTc.MTS'

Fortunately, FFMPEG was fine to turn this straight into an MP4 (albeit a rather large one) in the script file DesFordConcat.sh::

    ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i DesVids.txt -c copy Revelation66.mp4
    
This output a perfect video. However, it was still a bit time-consuming. The final script still needs work, but is a significant improvement::

    #!/bin/bash
    # DesFordConcat3.sh
    # Concatenates MTS files into 1 file, then converts that to mp4
    # WARNING: conversion takes ages - e.g., upwards of 40mins for 2.4 gig file - in 
    #          Handbrake, VLC and FFMPEG. Which is why I went to veryfast instead of slow.
    # USAGE: ./DesFordConcat.h xx (where xx is the file number, e.g., 66) [3]
    # Robyn Hahn - 06/Jun/2020
    if [ "$1" != "" ]; then
        ffmpeg -i ./Rev/NTa.mp4 -q 0 ./Rev/NTa.MTS
        ffmpeg -i ./Rev/NTb.mp4 -q 0 ./Rev/NTb.MTS
        if [ "$2" = "3" ]; then
            ffmpeg -i ./Rev/NTc.mp4 -q 0 ./Rev/NTc.MTS
            ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i DesVids3.txt -c copy NT.MTS
        else
            ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i DesVids.txt -c copy NT.MTS
        fi
        ffmpeg -i NT.MTS -c:a copy -c:v libx264 -preset veryfast -crf 18 -f mp4 "Revelation${1}.mp4"
    else
        echo "Positional parameter 1 is empty"
    fi

Samyang T1.5 24mm
=================

**Description**

Samyang’s **24mm T1.5 VDSLR II ED AS IF UMC** is a wide angle manual focus cine lens designed for full frame and smaller sensor sizes and is known for its beautiful bokeh. It has been carefully engineered for professional film and video work, with the focus gear ring allowing the use of follow focus systems.

The decoupled aperture changes quietly and smoothly via a second gear ring. 

The T number of 1.5 refers to the actual light transmission, while distance scales are marked on both sides of the lens to allow easy and precise control. This lens features 13 elements in 12 groups, including 4 extra low dispersion (ED) and 2 glass aspherical elements (ASP). These combine to minimise colour aberration and produce exceptional image quality with high contrast. Samyang’s Ultra Multi Coating (UMC) technology optimises light transmission and minimises flare and ghosting. A detachable petal-shaped lens hood is supplied.

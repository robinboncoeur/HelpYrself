Excel 2016 VBA Apps

Overview
********


I currently have two VBA-based apps I wrote for Queen Elizabeth II Jubilee Hospital in Coopers Plains, QLD. I intend to maintain those apps, which will include:

   * fixing bugs that testing had not revealed
   
   * adding features as requested
   
   * data management
   
These apps are CallSheet and AssetMgr.

In order to remotely fix bugs, I'm looking at the following strategy:

   * have users avail themselves of the issues section of the app's GitHub page
   
   * identify, eradicate and test the latest version of the app in my possession
   
   * publish the code on the GitHub page
   
   * have the user insert the fixed code into their version of the app
   
The last part of the strategy will need to be assessed for feasability.

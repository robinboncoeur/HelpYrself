Grub-Customizer
***************

Dual-boot systems use GRUB to allow booting to one OS or another. Grub-customizer by `Daniel Richter <https://launchpad.net/~danielrichter2007/+archive/ubuntu/grub-customizer>`_ is quite nice but somehow doesn't fully work for me... it is missing a step::

    sudo update-grub

needed for the picture to actually take.


Updating PATH
*************

In Ubuntu, edit /etc/environment. Its sole purpose is to store Environment Variables. Originally the $PATH variable is defined here. This is a paste from my /etc/environment file::

    PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games"

So you can just open up this file as root and add whatever you want.

For Immediate results, Run (try as normal user and root)::

    source /etc/environment && export PATH

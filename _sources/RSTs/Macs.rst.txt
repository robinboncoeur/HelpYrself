Basic Tip and Tricks
********************

===============
Screen Captures
===============

For the whole screen::

    [Shift][Command][3]

or for a part of it::

    [Shift][Command][4]

You'll get a rectangular outliner to define what you want capturing. To change the type of image that gets saved (default is .png), open Terminal and enter::

    defaults write com.apple.screencapture type png

The last string can be changed to jpg, tiff or even pdf.



======================
Toggle File Visibility
======================

Make sure a folder is actually active, then press [Shift] [Command] [.]



======================
Get the Path to a File
======================

To quickly find the **fully-qualified path** to a file, open a copy of terminal and drop the file onto it.



========================
Make a Script Executable
========================

Shell scripts must be executable files in order to run. You can use the chmod command to indicate that the text file is executable (that is, its contents can be run as a shell script). In the Terminal app  on your Mac, use the cd command to move into the directory that contains the file you want to make executable. For example::

    cd YourScriptDirectory

Enter the chmod command. For example::

    chmod 755 YourScriptName.sh

After making the shell script file executable, you can run it by entering its pathname::

    ~/Documents/Dev/YourScriptName.sh

or::

    cd ~/Documents/Dev/ 
    ./YourScriptName.sh



===========================
Make a Py Script Executable
===========================

Make sure you have::

    #!/usr/local/bin/python3

at the top of the script (for Python3 scripts). Then, in Terminal, issue a::

    chmod +x -/path/NameOfScript.py

Advanced Software Work
**********************

==============================
Formatting a USB Drive to GUID
==============================

When I try to erase and format a USB drive from the MBR to GUID I can not find a way to do that. The partition button is grayed out and I'm stuck.

To format a drive using Disk Utility first be sure you see the entire drive. In Disk Utility menu bar the last icon on the left "View" set to "All Devices". Then choose your entire drive (Uppermost, unindented icon). Format Mac OS (Extended) GUID Partition Disk. Erase.





=======================
Cloning An SSD on a Mac
=======================

Disk Utility has always been able to create clones, although the app refers to the process as Restore, as in restoring data from a source drive to a target drive. The restore function isn't just for drives. It will work with just about any storage device that you can mount to your Mac, including disk images, hard drives, SSDs, and USB flash drives.

**How Restore Works**

The Restore function in Disk Utility uses a block copy function that can speed up the copy process. It also makes an almost exact copy of the source device. What "almost exact" means is that a block copy moves everything in a data block from one device to the other. The results are almost an exact copy of the original. A file copy copies the data file by file. While the information remains the same, the location of the file on the source and destination devices will likely be different.

Using a block copy is faster, but it does have some limits that affect when it can be used, the most important being that copying block by block requires that both the source and destination devices be first unmounted from your Mac. This ensures that block data doesn't change during the copy process. Don’t worry, though; you don’t have to do the unmounting. Disk Utility’s Restore function takes care of that for you. But it does mean that neither the source nor the destination can be in use when you use the Restore capabilities.

**To Restore a Non-Startup Volume**

You can’t use the Restore function on the current startup drive, or any drive that has files in use. If you need to clone your startup drive, you can make use of either your Mac's Recovery HD volume or any drive that has a bootable copy of OS X installed.

	1. Launch Disk Utility, located at /Applications/Utilities.
	2. The Disk Utility app will open, displaying a single window divided into three spaces: a toolbar, a sidebar showing currently mounted drives and volumes, and an info pane, showing information about the currently selected device in the sidebar.
	3. In the sidebar, select the volume to which you want to copy/clone data. The volume you select will be the destination drive for the Restore operation.
	4. Select Restore from Disk Utility’s Edit menu.
	5. A sheet will drop down, asking you to select from a drop-down menu the source device to use for the Restore process. The sheet will also warn you that the volume you selected as the destination will be erased, and its data will be replaced with data from the source volume.
	6. Use the drop-down menu next to the "Restore from" text to select a source volume, and then click the Restore button.
	7. The Restore process will begin. A new drop-down sheet will display a status bar indicating how far along in the Restore process you are. You can also see detailed information by clicking the Show Details disclosure triangle - although there's really not much there. Note: *this process takes a long time (hours) especially if the source is via usb... we're talking hours!*
	8. Once the Restore process is complete, the drop-down sheet’s Done button will become available. Click Done to close the Restore sheet.
	

**Restore Using a Startup Drive**

When you use the Restore function, both the destination and the source must be able to be unmounted. Your startup drive can't be active if you want to restore it. Instead, you can start your Mac from another volume that contains a bootable version of the Mac OS. The one you use can be any volume attached to your Mac, including a USB flash drive, an external, or the Recovery HD volume.

A complete step-by-step guide is available in `Use the Recovery HD Volume to Reinstall OS X or Troubleshoot Mac Problems <https://www.lifewire.com/use-recovery-hd-volume-to-reinstall-os-x-2259971>`_.



===========================
Slow Boot after SSD Upgrade
===========================

**Question**:

My MacBook Pro extremely slow after SSD Upgrade. I upgraded the standard hard drive to a SSD. I cloned the factory drive to the SSD using Super Duper. After cloning the HDD to the SSD I installed it and turned it on. It booted up but not quite as quickly as I would expect for an SSD.

    * Verified and repaired disk permissions.
    * Restarted. Boot up time about 1 minute 20 seconds.
    * Shut down.
    * Reset PRAM.
    * Boot up time about 1 minute.
    * Restarted. Boot up time about 43 minutes.

Didn't work.

**Answer**:

The startup disk setting is pointing to a disk that's no longer in your system. Most probably the OS can't find it and is waiting for it to spin up: it won't try the new SSD until a timeout occurs:

    1. Go to System Preferences -> Startup Disk
    2. Click on the bottom left Lock tu unlock the changes
    3. Select Macintosh HD (it's likely to be the only on the list)
    4. Click 'Restart...'

Be patient: the restart can take a few minutes.

====================
Prior to Any Repairs 
====================

Look up your **exact** Mac's specs on `EveryMac.com <https://everymac.com/ultimate-mac-lookup/>`_ using the serial number. This can be found under Mac Menu (Apple left-hand corner) "About This Mac" -> Serial Number, or for macbooks, on the bottom cover.

Additionally, some `iMac-specific information <https://everymac.com/systems/apple/imac/imac-aluminum-faq/imac-intel-aluminum-processor-upgrade-instructions.html>`_.

For repairs, I recommend `iFixit for repairing iMacs <https://www.ifixit.com/Search?doctype=guide&query=iMac>`_. For example, use this link::

====================================
Replacing a Battery in a Macbook Pro
====================================

Note: *these instructions are mostly from the iFixit site*::

	https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Pro+13-Inch+Unibody+Mid+2012+Battery+Replacement/10365

Place the macbook face down on some paper towels or flat soft cloth. Do this on a table in a well-lit room. 'Flat' is important, because if you do this in your lap, besides risking the loss of those *teeny-tiny* screws, as you put the bottom back on it can distort - I know from experience, happened to **ME**! Remove the bottom case. I've included the screwdriver for these ten screws in the longish box in the Macbook box - the one with the hole in it. You will need to remove:

	* Three 14.4 mm Phillips #00 screws

	* Three 3.5 mm Phillips #00 screws

	* Four 3.5 mm shouldered Phillips #00 screws

.. image:: https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/macrepair/Ac-Battery1.png

Pry the bottom off with your fingers at the vents.

.. image:: https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/macrepair/Ac-Battery2.png


I've included paperwork, a screwdriver for the battery screws (they're tri-point) and the screws in a ziplock bag. Remove all this before sliding in the battery. It only goes in one way:

.. image:: https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/macrepair/Ac-Battery3.png

Attach the following two screws:

	* One 5.6 mm Tri-point screw

	* One 13 mm Tri-point screw
	
.. image:: https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/macrepair/Ac-Battery4.png

Note: *the longer one goes near the battery connector to the logic board. You may need to slightly adjust the battery a bit for the screw to "take"*.

Connect the battery connector to the logic board.

.. image:: https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/macrepair/Ac-Battery5.png

Replace the bottom with the vents towards the back (where the screen hinges to the laptop) and screw the bottom in place as shown:

.. image:: https://www.tightbytes.com/images/projects/macrepair/Ac-Battery1.png

Note: *when replacing the small screws, align them perpendicular to the slight curvature of the case (they don't go straight down)*.

When installing a new battery, you should calibrate it after installation in order to maximise its lifespan:

	* Charge it to 100%, and then keep charging it for at least 2 more hours.
	
	* Unplug and use it normally to drain the battery. When you see the low battery warning, save your work, and keep your laptop on until it goes to sleep due to low battery.
	
	* Wait at least 5 hours, then charge your laptop uninterrupted to 100%.

If you notice any unusual behavior or problems after installing your new battery, you may need to reset your MacBook's SMC.

To Avoid Win10 Deactivation
***************************

==========
Background
==========

On December 2nd, I purchased a Windows 10 Pro licence to create a fresh install of Windows in VirtualBox on my Mac. I got the system all the way I wanted it including activation and removing all the cruft with a Windows debloat script by Chris Titus, then did an export.

To test that everything wortked fine, I deleted the existing install then imported the OVA... and found that Win10 had lost its activation.

Looking on StackExchange revealed that the culprit was a changing set of UUIDs. The commenter was using VMWare so he was referencing .VMX files. The analog to that appears to be the .VBOX file in your current install.

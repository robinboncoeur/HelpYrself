Python including Pip

Pip Installs
************

For PyTube, to install the latest source directly from github using pip, type this in your command line::

    pip install git+https://github.com/nficano/pytube.git


PyCharm and Kivy Install
************************

To explore: in Ubuntu 12.04, one user solved it this way:

    * Install CYTHON -- Do this First!
    * Install the Python header files: sudo apt-get install python-dev
    * Install KIVY: [sudo apt-get install Python-Kivy] or [sudo apt-get install python3-kivy]
    * Install the kivy-examples: sudo apt-get install kivy-examples

An important `link <http://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-linux.html#ubuntu-12-04-with-python-2-7>`_ for Python 2x was included. The user went on to say that "the code builds and runs, but does not display in Python. I will edit this answer if I fix that, but this should at least get you started."

Pip Installs
************

PyTube
======

To install the latest source directly from github using pip, type this in your command line::

    pip install git+https://github.com/nficano/pytube.git

Usually a good idea to upgrade pip while you're at it::

    pip install --upgrade pip


PyTube Regex Errors
===================

The fix was published 19 Jan, 2019 on the `Github issues page <https://github.com/nficano/pytube/issues/353#issuecomment-455116197>`_. It essentially involved patching cypher.py and helpers.py. Now, to find those files on my Mac: not trivial. Finally invoked "find"::

    sudo find / -iname "*.py"

to get a lot of cruft, and this::

    /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pytube/__main__.py
    /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pytube/captions.py
    /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pytube/cipher.py
    /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pytube/cli.py
    /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pytube/compat.py
    /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pytube/contrib/__init__.py
    /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pytube/contrib/playlist.py
    /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pytube/exceptions.py
    /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pytube/extract.py
    /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pytube/helpers.py
    /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pytube/itags.py
    /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pytube/logging.py
    /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pytube/mixins.py
    /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pytube/query.py
    /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pytube/request.py
    /usr/local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/pytube/streams.py

Patched the files 03 Mar, 2019 and voila, success!


PyCharm and Kivy Install
========================

To explore: in Ubuntu 12.04, one user solved it this way:

    * Install CYTHON -- Do this First!
    * Install the Python header files: sudo apt-get install python-dev
    * Install KIVY: [sudo apt-get install Python-Kivy] or [sudo apt-get install python3-kivy]
    * Install the kivy-examples: sudo apt-get install kivy-examples

An important `link <http://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-linux.html#ubuntu-12-04-with-python-2-7>`_ for Python 2x was included. The user went on to say that "the code builds and runs, but does not display in Python. I will edit this answer if I fix that, but this should at least get you started."

Note: *PyCharm turned out to be a too-hard-basket editor to get working properly with Kivy, so I went with Brackets instead.*


Brackets Install...
===================
... **in Linux Mint**

A no-brainer. For Windows, Mac or Linux, just get onto `Brackets.io <http://brackets.io>`_: it will automatically offer the download for your host OS. In Mint, download the .deb and install.


Running imported Modules in Kivy
================================

A simple pip install doesn't seem to expose pip-installed modules to Kivy. You actually have to::

    kivy3 -m pip install oauth2client

    or

    kivy3 -m pip3 install gspread

to get Kivy to see them.


Kivy kv file Python...
======================
... **syntax highlighting**

Create a brackets.json file with the following code::

Project: Roster App
===================

Name of application::

    rosterapp21s9453

Credentials set up `here <https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials?showWizardSurvey=true&project=rosterapp21s9453>`_ :: 

    https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials?showWizardSurvey=true&project=rosterapp21s9453

In google drive, set things up to be able to access with Python `this way <https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/02/an-easy-way-to-read-and-write-to-a-google-spreadsheet-in-python.html>`_.

Installed gspread and oauth2client via pip3::

    pip3 install gspread oauth2client

=====================================================

The Late Show with Stephen Colbert - Facing threats of impeachment, and with calls for his resignation coming from even the conservative Wall Street Journal editorial board, the president on Thursday released a video in which he unconvincingly condemned the insurrection he incited, and begrudgingly admitted that a new administration would take office following an orderly transition of power on January 20th.

Some experts claim regenerative agriculture can reverse climate change by sequestering atmospheric CO2 in soil.  Regenerative organic farming emphasizes the importance of soil health and includes practices like cover cropping, crop rotation, holistic animal grazing, and the use of compost.

Proponents suggest it could increase biodiversity, make farms more resilient to floods, produce healthier food, and improve farm animal welfare. "Healthy soil equals healthy food equals healthy people," says Jeff Moyer, the CEO of the Rodale Institute, which has studied regenerative and organic farming methods for 70 years. "The age of chemical food production is gone. Regenerative organic agriculture is really the future."

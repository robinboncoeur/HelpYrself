<p>Inspired by Charles Massy’s best-selling book “Call of the Reed Warbler”, filmmaker Amy Browne set out across the dry farming country of South East NSW to meet Massy and the other trailblazing farmers bringing new life to their land.</p>
<p>Regenerative agriculture is one of the most promising wide-scale environmental solutions. This short documentary is a comprehensive journey through a variety of landscapes and regenerative farming techniques.</p>
<p>‘From the Ground Up’ is a story of genuine change and inspiration - tracing the steps of individuals who transformed their practices following the life-changing realisation - that farmers have a unique opportunity to heal the planet.</p>

<p><strong>Regenerative farming</strong>: A ‘natural way’ to help counteract drought
(Australian Story)</p>
<p>For five generations, Charles Massy’s family rode on the sheep’s back and nearly destroyed their land in the process. When drought in the 80s and 90s almost sent him broke, the Cooma farmer switched to regenerative agriculture and watched his overgrazed land recover.</p>
<p>In his mid-50s, Charles Massy started a PhD, visiting 80 top regenerative farmers to see what they were doing differently.  That led to his ground-breaking book Call of the Reed Warbler, a plea to farmers to start working with nature.</p>
<p><em>National Farmers’ Federation’s Fiona Simson says this story does not fully represent her position on regenerative agriculture, which is one of broad support.</em></p>

<p><em>with Regenerative Agriculture</em></p>
<p>Regenerative agriculture offers a future for sustainable farming of meat in line with nature’s needs, by using holistic management and organic/biodynamic practices and even sequestering carbon in the soil – so important in our response to our climate crisis. At Mangarara, in New Zealand’s beautiful Hawke’s Bay, Greg Hart and his family are in the process of restoring 1500 acres of land, conventionally farmed for over 150 years, into the paradise it once was.</p>

<h3>Regenerative Agriculture in Deep Creek<a class="headerlink" href="#regenerative-agriculture-in-deep-creek" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Ben Ryan is a sheep and cattle farmer operating on 760 hectares in Deep Creek, approximately 100km south of Adelaide, on the Fleurieu Peninsula. We visited Ben and his family in autumn and winter last year to chat about the journey into farming regeneratively and capture life on their farm.</p>
<p>In the last 20 years, the Ryan family has transitioned their approach to farm management from conventional farming methods to regenerative agriculture. For them, the core concept is to maximise energy from the naturally occurring resources. Ben says, “The farm aims to operate and prosper without the need for any external energy, except that provided from nature; sun, wind, rain, air, animal, plants and human ability.”</p>
<p>By practising regenerative methods, their overall awareness of the land, on which they both live and farm, has been increased. This has led to making strategic decisions that strike a far greater balance with the natural environment, while continuing to produce a high-quality product. For the Ryans, farming regeneratively has meant adopting holistic grazing practices, such as rotating large herds through smaller paddocks with optimal rest periods.</p>
<p>Ben believes that “maintaining a diverse ground-cover is really essential; it protects our soil which is good for the environment and our production”. He says,</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>“Good pasture is about maximising the growth and diversity we have now. Grazing management optimises the opportunity for new species, including deep-rooted perennials to prosper.”</p>

<h3>A New Beginning for the Australian Landscape<a class="headerlink" href="#a-new-beginning-for-the-australian-landscape" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>“If the Australian landscape was better understood, we could save the world from environmental disaster” ~ Peter Andrews OAM.</p>
<p>Natural Sequence Farming (NSF) is a system of regenerative farming based on the science of the old Australian landscape and principles developed by Peter Andrews OAM. Find out <a class="reference external" href="http://www.peterandrewsoam.com">more</a>.</p>
<p>NSF takes a holistic view of water, air, soil, plant and animal interactions in the landscape. It uses natural functions where possible, or careful mimicry of them and their natural sequences, to address soil and water degradation and biodiversity loss. Interventions to restore or enhance natural function are made either through implementation of structures or by changes to farm layout and animal management.</p>
<p>The implementation of Natural Sequence Farming at the Mulloon Creek at Mulloon Creek Natural Farms is using Peter’s techniques to recreate the chain of ponds that would have existed in its undisturbed state, and through this raising the streambed and the level of water in the floodplain.</p>

A Quick Note on why "HelpYrself"
********************************

I'm getting old and forgetful and keep reinventing the wheel, searching for answers that I'd already dealt with not all that long ago.

Hence, this document.

As in all of open source, we tend to create solutions to "scratch our own itch". If anyone else finds it useful, fantastic. However, as with anything published, information can become dated, no-longer-relevant or, because the goal-posts have moved, just plain wrong. Consider this when using this information.

Grub-Customizer
***************

Dual-boot systems use GRUB to allow booting to one OS or another. Grub-customizer by `Daniel Richter <https://launchpad.net/~danielrichter2007/+archive/ubuntu/grub-customizer>`_ is quite nice but somehow doesn't fully work for me... it is missing a step::

    sudo update-grub

needed for the picture to actually take.

A Quick Note on why HelpYrself
******************************

I'm getting old and forgetful and keep reinventing the wheel, searching for answers that I'd already dealt with not all that long ago.

Hence, this document. I'm even reminding myself how to do certain things in Sphinx, which is the tool I use to create this document.

As in all things open source, we tend to create solutions to "scratch our own itch". If anyone else finds it useful, fantastic. However, as with anything published, information can become dated, no-longer-relevant or, because the goal-posts have moved, just plain wrong. Consider this when using this information.

*************************************
Reminders [to Myself] of Sphinx Stuff
*************************************

============
Sphinx Links
============

Can be found here: `Cross Referencing With Sphinx <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html>`_.

=============
Inline images
=============

For externally-stored images (most will be stored on Tightbytes, for my pages)::

	* .. image:: http://www.tightbytes.com/Music/CReinecke/CReinecke1890.jpg

and for those stored with the data files::

	* .. image:: ../images/blAltRtClick01.png



==============
Embedded Video
==============

This code::

.. raw:: html
   
   <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/123xxxXXXyZ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

   <hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">

Should have 11 characters::

	3LbsmS5TJXA
	123xxxXXXyZ



==============
Embedded Audio
==============

This code::

	.. raw:: html

		<audio controls="controls">
		  <source src="http://tightbytes.com/music/Sketches/Sketch11.mp3" type="audio/wav">
		  Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element. 
		</audio>

...produces:

.. raw:: html

    <audio controls="controls">
      <source src="http://tightbytes.com/music/Sketches/Sketch11.mp3" type="audio/wav">
      Your browser does not support the <code>audio</code> element. 
    </audio>



==================
Creating Dotpoints
==================

Once you've decided:

  * Select A.

  * Select B. 

  * To identify C.

  * Finally, click on D.


Note: *setting things to italics like this makes more impact - these have yielded reasonable results. You will almost certainly find better settings, which is the whole point of sharing this*.



================
Links Management
================

Here's a typical example of embedding a link: Blender-for-Mac users, please refer to the `Mac user help <http://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/6173/where-does-console-output-go>`_ page.



===============
Another Example
===============

As you can see from the example, an example of a fully-qualified path for Linux would be:

   /home/robyn/Documents/Blender/Projects/AllTextures/AllSkin/Antonia/

or, for the Mac:

   /Volumes/500GB/Blender/Projects/AllTextures/AllSkin/Antonia/

or, for Windows:

   E:\\MyRuntime\\runtime\\textures\\VendorName\\ImagesFolder\\Character\\



==========================
Horizontal Separator Lines
==========================

The code is this (minus the '*')::

	* .. raw:: html
   
   <hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">

...which produces this:

.. raw:: html
   
   <hr style="height:4px;border-width:0;color:gray;background-color:gray">

Notes to Self
=============

Danielle / Ryse - - Lisa / Max


If the solar system was brought about by an accidental collision, then the appearance of organic life on this planet was also an accident, and the whole evolution of Man was an accident too. If so, then all our present thoughts are mere accidents - the accidental by-product of the movement of atoms. And this holds for the thoughts of the materialists and astronomers as well as for anyone else's. But if their thoughts - i.e., of Materialism and Astronomy - are merely accidental by-products, why should we believe them to be true? I see no reason for believing that one accident should be able to give me a correct account of all the other accidents. It's like expecting that the accidental shape taken by the splash when you upset a milk-jug should give you a correct account of how the jug was made and why it was upset.

Biological Evolution is a theory about how organisms change. Some of these changes have made organisms, judged by human standards, ‘better’ – more flexible, stronger, more conscious. The majority of the changes have not done so. As J. B. S. Haldane says, in evolution progress is the exception and degeneration the rule. Popular Evolutionism ignores this. For it, ‘Evolution’ simply means ‘improvement’. And it is not confined to organisms, but applied also to moral qualities, institutions, arts, intelligence and the like. There is thus lodged in popular thought the conception that improvement is, somehow, a cosmic law: a conception to which the sciences give no support at all. There is no general tendency even for organisms to improve.


You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness about me,  yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life.

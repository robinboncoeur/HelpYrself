Audio Expression Control
========================

In order to fine-manage expression CC, `TouchOSC <https://hexler.net/touchosc>`_!

**Brand-new app. Brand-new powerful editor.**

We've listened for the past 10 years and we've re-written the application from the ground up - with speed, features and usability in mind. A GPU-powered, fast and advanced integrated editor is part of TouchOSC on all platforms - create the most complex of control layouts with ease and precision.

**Cross-Platform. We mean it.**

TouchOSC runs EVERYWHERE! From the phone in your pocket to your iTablet Proâ„¢. From a Raspberry Pi to a Windows touch-screen workstation. We support all major operating systems and architectures and the full feature set is available across all versions. We support Windows / macOS / Linux / iOS / Android natively on multiple chips and bits.

**MIDI, OSC and more.**

TouchOSC supports sending and receiving any number of MIDI and OSC messages on many connections simultaneously. On top of OSC over UDP & TCP, we support every type of wired & wireless MIDI connection your device can offer, including MIDI over USB on iOS and Android.

**Cross-Network. Synchronized editing.**

Multiple instances of TouchOSC can be connected on the network for synchronized editing. Use the precision of your desktop's mouse and keyboard for fine-grained, detailed editing - test-drive and preview in real-time on all connected touch-screen devices at the same time.

**Scripting and local messages.**

A lightweight and fast scripting engine allows deep access to all aspects of your controller and enables limitless customization and interactivity. For less complex tasks we've added local messages - simply wire up controls to transmit or display values; no need to break out the big (code) guns. Easy.

**This is only the beginning.**

We've supported and updated TouchOSC Mk1 for more than 10 years at this point, without ever charging for an upgrade, and we're planning to do the same for this new version. We've already got a whole bunch of features cooking that were just not quite ready yet. There is so much more to come... and here's a `guide to get up to speed <https://timcorpus.net/index.php/2021/11/16/ultimate-guide-to-touch-osc-part-1-2>`_.

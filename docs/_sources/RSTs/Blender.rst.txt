******************************************
Reviewing Script Installation Instructions
******************************************

   * Unzip (de-archive) the FigureShaders-master.zip file

   * Open Blender

   * To install the FigureShader script:

      1. File -> User Preferences -> Add-Ons tab

      2. At the bottom of this dialogue, click on Install From File...

      3. Navigate to where you downloaded the zip file and select the **make_shaders.zip file**, within the unzipped folder FigureShaders folder. Click 'Install from File...'

      4. Browse your add-ons - click on 'User' under 'Categories' - and find the add-on. It is called 'Material: Shaders for Imported Figures'. Tick the box on the right to activate it. **(If this does not appear, check in the scripts/addons/ folder for the existence of a make_shaders folder, and that all these files are within that folder).**

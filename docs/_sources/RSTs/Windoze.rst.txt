Which Updates to Avoid
**********************

...depends on how paranoid you want to be about MS invading your privacy, and how much you're prepared to put up with having Windows 10 forced on you. (Oh, and also thirdly, wanting to get away with using a pirated version of Windows, or at least one that won't activate as genuine, which isn't always the same thing)...

So... If you don't want Windows 10, you're best off avoiding these::

    KB2952664
    KB2976978
    KB2977759
    KB2990214
    KB3021917
    KB3044374
    KB3035583
    KB3139929
    KB3150513

as they're all Windows 10 preparation updates. If you're worried about being spied upon, I'd give these a miss::

    KB3021917
    KB3022345
    KB3068708
    KB3075249
    KB3080149
    KB3081954

as they bring Windows 7 "telemetry" stuff into line with Windows 10 (this is info that gets phoned-home from your copy of Windows back to Microsoft).

KB971033, if it hasn't been finally retreated. Same for KB2505438... have to hide them on installs as these two will kill Windows activation.

Upgrade - OEM to Retail
***********************

Upgraded my Vbox install of Win7 to retail, purchased on 08-Dec-2021 from PCSalesOnline.com for AUD$37.11. Converted the OEM licence in cmd (run as admin):

	SLUI 3
	
brings up a GUI to enter the new activation code. Done. Hope I can upgrade to Win10 now.

****************************
Install - Convert MBR to GPT
****************************

**Converting to GPT format using Command Prompt in Windows Setup**:

    * Power off the computer, and insert or connect the Windows installation DVD or USB drive.
    * Power on the computer and tap F12 key until the One-Time Boot Menu appears.
    * Select the Windows installation DVD or USB in the menu and press Enter key.
    * From the Windows Setup screen, press Shift + F10 key to open a Command Prompt window.
    * In the Command Prompt window, type **diskpart** and press [Enter] key.
    * To identify the disk drive to reformat, type **list disk** and press [Enter] key.
    * To select the drive and reformat it, type **select disk #** (substitute # with the disk number for example select disk 1) and press [Enter] key.
    * Type **clean** and press [Enter] key.
    * Type **convert gpt** and press [Enter] key.
    * Type **exit** and press [Enter] key.
    
Close the Command Prompt window. If you are installing Windows, go to the Windows Setup process.

VBA-Custom Popup
****************

The following code example shows how to create a custom menu with four menu options, each of which calls a macro. Sample code provided by: Holy Macro! Books, Holy Macro! It's 2,500 Excel VBA Examples. 

The following code example sets up the custom menu when the workbook is opened, and deletes it when the workbook is closed::

	Option Explicit

	Private Sub Workbook_BeforeClose(Cancel As Boolean)
	   With Application.CommandBars("Worksheet Menu Bar")
		  On Error Resume Next
		  .Controls("&MyFunction").Delete
		  On Error GoTo 0
	   End With
	End Sub

	Private Sub Workbook_Open()
	   Dim objPopUp As CommandBarPopup
	   Dim objBtn As CommandBarButton
	   With Application.CommandBars("Worksheet Menu Bar")
		  On Error Resume Next
		  .Controls("MyFunction").Delete
		  On Error GoTo 0
		  Set objPopUp = .Controls.Add( _
			 Type:=msoControlPopup, _
			 before:=.Controls.Count, _
			 temporary:=True)
	   End With
	   objPopUp.Caption = "&MyFunction"
	   Set objBtn = objPopUp.Controls.Add
	   With objBtn
		  .Caption = "Formula Entry"
		  .OnAction = "Cbm_Active_Formula"
		  .Style = msoButtonCaption
	   End With
	   Set objBtn = objPopUp.Controls.Add
	   With objBtn
		  .Caption = "Value Entry"
		  .OnAction = "Cbm_Active_Value"
		  .Style = msoButtonCaption
	   End With
	   Set objBtn = objPopUp.Controls.Add
	   With objBtn
		  .Caption = "Formula Selection"
		  .OnAction = "Cbm_Formula_Select"
		  .Style = msoButtonCaption
	   End With
	   Set objBtn = objPopUp.Controls.Add
	   With objBtn
		  .Caption = "Value Selection"
		  .OnAction = "Cbm_Value_Select"
		  .Style = msoButtonCaption
	   End With
	End Sub
	

The menu "MyFunction" is added when the workbook opens, and is deleted when the workbook closes. It provides four menu options, with a macro assigned to each option. The user-defined function (UDF) "MyFunction" multiplies three values in a range together and returns the result::

	Function MyFunction(rng As Range) As Double
	   MyFunction = rng(1) * rng(2) * rng(3)
	End Function


Formula Entry: This menu option is assigned the macro "Cbm_Active_Formula", which calls the UDF named "MyFunction" that multiplies the numbers in the preceding 3 cells, and stores value of the UDF in the active cell. You must have values in the range B6:D6 and select cell E6 before clicking this menu option::

	Sub Cbm_Active_Formula()
	   'setting up the variables.
	   Dim intLen As Integer, strRng As String

	   'Using the active cell, E6.
	   With ActiveCell
		  'Check to see if the preceding offset has valid data, and if there are three values
		  If IsEmpty(.Offset(0, -1)) Or .Column < 4 Then

			  'If the data is not valid, call MyFunction directly as a formula, but with no parameters.
			 .Formula = "=MyFunction()"
			  Application.SendKeys "{ENTER}"
		  Else

			 'If the data is valid, create a range of the preceding 3 cells
			 strRng = Range(Cells(.Row, .Column - 3), _
				Cells(.Row, .Column - 1)).Address
			 intLen = Len(strRng)

			 'Call MyFunction as a formula, with the range as the parameter.
			 .Formula = "=MyFunction(" & strRng & ")"
				Application.SendKeys "{ENTER}"
		  End If
	   End With
	End Sub


Value Entry: This menu option is assigned the macro "Cbm_Active_Value", which enters the value produced by the UDF named "MyFunction" into the active cell. You must have values in the range B6:D6 and select cell E6 before clicking this menu option::

	Sub Cbm_Active_Value()
	   'Set up the variables.
	   Dim intLen As Integer, strRng As String

	   'Using the active cell, E6.
	   With ActiveCell
		  'If there isn't enough room in the column, then send a warning.
		  If .Column < 4 Then
			 Beep
			 MsgBox "The function can be used only starting from column D!"

		  'Otherwise, call MyFunction, using the range of the previous 3 cells.
		  Else
			 ActiveCell.Value = MyFunction(Range(ActiveCell.Offset(0, -3), _
				ActiveCell.Offset(0, -1)))
		  End If
	   End With
	End Sub


Formula Selection: This menu option is assigned the macro "Cbm_Formula_Select", which uses an InputBox for the user to select the range which the UDF "MyFunction" should calculate. The return value of the UDF is stored in the active cell::

	Sub Cbm_Formula_Select()
	   'Set up the variables.
	   Dim rng As Range

	   'Use the InputBox dialog to set the range for MyFunction, with some simple error handling.
	   Set rng = Application.InputBox("Range:", Type:=8)
	   If rng.Cells.Count <> 3 Then
		  MsgBox "Length, width and height are needed -" & _
			 vbLf & "please select three cells!"
		  Exit Sub
	   End If
	   'Call MyFunction in the active cell, E6.
	   ActiveCell.Formula = "=MyFunction(" & rng.Address & ")"
	End Sub


Value Selection: This menu option is assigned the macro "Cbm_Value_Select", which uses an InputBox for the user select the range which the UDF "MyFunction" should calculate. The value is stored in the active cell directly, instead of being returned by the UDF::

	Sub Cbm_Value_Select()
	   'Set up the variables.
	   Dim rng As Range

	   'Use the InputBox dialog to set the range for MyFunction, with some simple error handling.
	   Set rng = Application.InputBox("Range:", Type:=8)
	   If rng.Cells.Count <> 3 Then
		 MsgBox "Length, width and height are needed -" & _
			 vbLf & "please select three cells!"
		  Exit Sub
	   End If

	   'Call MyFunction by value using the active cell, E6.
	   ActiveCell.Value = MyFunction(rng)
	End Sub

Oracle's VirtualBox

===========================
Avoiding Win10 Deactivation
===========================

**Background**

On December 2nd, I purchased a Windows 10 Pro licence to create a fresh install of Windows in VirtualBox on my Mac. I got the system all the way I wanted it including activation and removing all the cruft with a Windows debloat script by Chris Titus, then did an export.

To test that everything wortked fine, I deleted the existing install then imported the OVA... and found that Win10 had lost its activation.

**Research**

Looking on StackExchange revealed that the culprit was a changing set of UUIDs. The commenter was using VMWare so he was referencing .VMX files. The analog to that appears to be the .VBOX file in your current install.

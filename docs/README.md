# Help Yourself First

I'm old and forgetful and find myself reinventing the wheel over and over. This repository will house tips on how to manage things like help files and new blender setups and so forth.

# Update Log

18.12.10 - *note: for dates I'm using the yy.mm.dd format*. Added the text files (.rst) that make up the help so that others - I'm looking at *you*, Jonita! :) - can download, copy-paste / chop-n-change as needed. Of course, it's always possible to simply highlight the text in the gh-pages file, but then it might also copy all the formatting.
